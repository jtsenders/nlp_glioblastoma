This code constitutes the source code used for a project on natural language processing (NLP) in glioblastoma patients. The aim of this study was to developed an open-source NLP pipeline for text mining of medical information using a corpus of free-text radiology reports of patients with a glioblastoma. The link to the original publication can be found here [insert link]. This code is made publicly available to promote the transparency and reproducibility of computer code used for NLP in clinical research. Suggestions for improvement are very welcome.

Please contact me for any questions, comments, or suggestions related to the code.

Kind regards,
